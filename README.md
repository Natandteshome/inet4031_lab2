# inet4031_lab2
This command:
git clone https://github.umn.edu/tesho012/inet4031_lab2.git
Did not work and is giving this error:
Cloning into 'inet4031_lab2'...
remote: Your GitHub Enterprise administrators are performing scheduled maintenance. If you have any questions, please contact help@umn.edu.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.umn.edu/tesho012/inet4031_lab2.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
In this instance I chose to upload via files and will try to use this command once the said server maintence comes back up.
